                            If you have a big backlog (don't we all?) then <a href="http://www.houseofmoran.com/">I</a> recommend giving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming_practices#Commitment_phase">The Planning Game</a>,

                        <h3>In the beginning...</h3>

                        <p><a href="http://www.houseofmoran.com/">I</a> started using <a href="http://trello.com/">Trello</a> a lot at work and at home. Backlogs were created, and started to grow. I'd seen
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming_practices#Commitment_phase">The Planning Game</a> work well in the past, so <a href="http://www.houseofmoran.com/">I</a> suggested to a colleague that
                            we try it out. <a href="http://www.houseofmoran.com/">I</a> was irked that we needed to write out the cards so that we could play it. I'm open to physical representations, but given we have the backlog in
                            <a href="http://trello.com/">Trello</a>, why can't we do it all online? So, "Nice to have" was born.
                        </p>

                        <h3>v0.0.1</h3>

                        <p>
                        <a href="http://www.houseofmoran.com/">I</a> wrote a first version over <a href="http://blog.houseofmoran.com/post/39084311065/nice-to-have-v0-0000001">xmas 2012</a> and started using it myself. Works, mostly, but very basic.
                        For instance, it doesn't remember the categorisations!
                        </p>

                        <h3>v0.0.2</h3>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Added saving of categorisations within the page (will clear on full page refresh). Practically, this means
                                it will remember where you put things when you switch between lists, or save to trello.</li>
                            <li><a href="https://trello.com/card/show-the-name-of-the-trello-board-as-well-as-it-s-id/50d4b39f3d7039c91b001237/18">
                                Show the 'name' of the Trello board, as well as it's ID...
                            </a></li>
                            <li>Added ability to print out the board. It shows the cards as numbers positioned on the board, and a numbered list of cards below (number is card shortId from trello)</li>
                            <li>Card area now scales with browser on resize</li>
                            <li>Refactorathon in progress to support <a href="https://trello.com/card/persist-categorisations-as-comments-e-g-nice-to-have-and-low-risk-load-and-use-to-choose-initial-position-on-area/50d4b39f3d7039c91b001237/11">persisting of categorisations</a></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>v0.1.0</h3>

                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://trello.com/card/persist-categorisations-as-comments-e-g-nice-to-have-and-low-risk-load-and-use-to-choose-initial-position-on-area/50d4b39f3d7039c91b001237/11">Save card positions as comments</a></li>
                            <li>Removed ability to print out the board. This was previously added to support sharing, which is now supported by simply sharing a url of the board.</li>
                        </ul>
